### Presented by: Helen Scott

## Note
My apologies, due to technical problems the ipynb of the analysis is not currently available. Once I return from the GRC I will add all scripts needed to re-create the figures in the poster here.

## GEM2CUE Package
The python package used to calculate CUE is available here: https://github.com/hgscott/GEM2CUE
Note, that to install the package you will have to clone/download the repository and install it from your local copy, i.e. `python3 -m pip install <path>`
